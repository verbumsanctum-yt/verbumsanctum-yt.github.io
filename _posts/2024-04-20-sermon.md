## *Introduction*

Brethren, today we explore a theme of significant relevance in our contemporary society — the purpose of the gifts of creation, particularly plants like marijuana, within a Biblical context. Let us reflect upon the divine wisdom embedded in the scriptures, particularly focusing on the stewardship responsibilities bestowed upon us by the Creator.

## *Creation and Divine Intent*

In the Book of Genesis, we read, "And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb yielding seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for food" (Genesis 1:29). Here, God explicitly defines the purpose of plants: to serve as nourishment and sustenance for all living creatures. This foundational text shows us that every plant, including marijuana, was created with a divine intent, part of the intricate web of life on Earth that God saw was "very good."

## *The Mandate of Stewardship*

Our role as stewards is explicitly defined in Genesis when God entrusts humanity with His creation: "And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth" (Genesis 1:28). This dominion is not of reckless control but of stewardship that respects, maintains, and wisely manages the divine creation.

## *The Role of Plants in Biblical Times*

Plants play various roles in the Bible, often used for healing and ritual purposes. For instance, the leaves of the tree in Revelation are said to be "for the healing of the nations" (Revelation 22:2). This indicates a divine acknowledgment of the medicinal and healing properties of plants, which can include the responsible use of marijuana in contexts where it alleviates suffering.
Scripture provides further guidance on the wise use of plants. Psalms highlight the role of plants in sustaining not just humans but all creatures: "He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth" (Psalms 104:14). Here, we see the ecological balance designed by God, where every plant has a role in the sustenance of life on Earth.

## *Ethical Considerations and Modern Use*

However, the scripture also cautions us about excess and the moral implications of our choices. Proverbs warns, "Wine is a mocker, strong drink a brawler; And whosoever erreth thereby is not wise" (Proverbs 20:1). In the letters to the Ephesians, we are reminded of the importance of sobriety: "And be not drunken with wine, wherein is riot, but be filled with the Spirit" (Ephesians 5:18). Similar principles can apply to the use of marijuana, where moderation and intention align with Biblical teachings on sobriety and self-control. Although referring to wine, this principle can be applied to all substances, including marijuana, advocating for moderation and caution to avoid the pitfalls of excess.

## *Conclusion: Walking in Wisdom*

In conclusion, let us ponder the role of every herb and plant within God's creation. We are called to exercise wisdom and stewardship, ensuring that our use of God’s gifts aligns with His purpose and commandments. As stewards of creation, it is our duty to use the earth's resources, including marijuana, in ways that are respectful, ethical, and ultimately glorifying to God.

Let us pray for wisdom and discernment in all things, guided by the Holy Scriptures and the Holy Spirit, to navigate the complexities of modern life while upholding our sacred responsibilities.
